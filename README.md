## What is this web application for? 🤷‍♀️

It is an interactive application that allows the user to conveniently assemble their own special burger using the constructor.

Also for registered users, you can view the order history. The user can see the order feed - a list of burgers that are being prepared right now or are already ready. This functionality is available live thanks to the web socket connection.
